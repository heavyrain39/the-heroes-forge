# The Heroes' Forge

> Let the heroes handle the combat. You handle the forge. Your war is not fought on the battlefield, but at the anvil. The revolutionary support RPG, „ÄäThe Heroes' Forge„Äã.

## üìñ About The Game

**The Heroes' Forge** is an idle support RPG where you take on the role of a blacksmith, not a hero. When a giant dungeon, the "Great Fissure," appears near your town, heroes from all over gather to conquer it. Your mission is to support these heroes by crafting and selling the best weapons and armor.

Instead of fighting monsters, your battle takes place at the anvil. You will mine ores, smelt ingots, and forge legendary equipment to help heroes delve deeper into the dungeon.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Unique Perspective:** Experience the classic RPG world from the refreshing viewpoint of a non-combatant supporter. Your success is measured by the success of the heroes you equip.
- **Deep Crafting System:** Gather a wide variety of materials from mining, logging, and even from monsters brought back by heroes. Combine them to craft thousands of items, from common iron swords to legendary EX-grade weapons.
- **Dynamic Hero Interaction:** Heroes are your customers. They earn gold in the dungeon and use it to buy better gear from your shop based on their budget and needs. Support them, and they will grow stronger, unlocking new skills and abilities.
- **Endless Progression:** The game doesn't end after conquering the dungeon.
  - **Reincarnation:** Be reborn with permanent perks that accelerate your growth, allowing you to reach new heights with each playthrough.
  - **Seasonal Rankings:** Compete with other blacksmiths worldwide every three months in a seasonal ranking system to see who can support their heroes to the deepest floor.
- **AI-Native Art Style:** All character and item assets are created using AI, featuring a unique and consistent "sticker-style" aesthetic.
